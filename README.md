Natural disaster loss prediction can be difficult as natural catastrophe comes with out much warnings and we need to act quickly. In this particular project I developed a predictive model that will forecast natural disaster related human and property damages. I used em-dat historical natural disaster database to collect data and build natural disaster predictive model using machine learning algorithms.
